It helps you to export HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests in Python. You can easily create custom scripts which switch between different HTTP versions and it might be helpful for demonstrating HTTP/2 exclusive attacks [Portswigger - HTTP/2 exclusive attacks](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/http2/performing-http2-exclusive-attacks)  

# Credits
Majority of the codes are copied from [burp-requests](https://github.com/silentsignal/burp-requests) and did some edits to work with HTTP/2 requests and Montoya API.
